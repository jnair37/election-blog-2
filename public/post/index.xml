      <description>&lt;div id=&#34;election-analytics-blog-2024&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Election Analytics Blog 2024&lt;/h1&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi! Welcome to my blog. I’m Jade and I’m part of the Election Analytics course at Harvard, where we are learning how to use data science to build predictive models and analyze the factors that drive elections. Follow along to see my predictions and models for each week leading up to the 2024 election!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve been looking at predictions using data about previous elections, relative to basic&#xD;&#xA;factors (incumbency, party) as well as to measures of economic well-being. However, we have a&#xD;&#xA;much more recent dataset into which we have not yet tapped: the thousands of public opinion&#xD;&#xA;polls that are conducted each year. Through the principles of sampling, polls appear to be&#xD;&#xA;relatively good estimates; a random subset of the population will behave, on average, similarly&#xD;&#xA;to the whole population. But this doesn’t mean polls have always gotten it right in practice; one&#xD;&#xA;of the most significant examples of this was 2016, where by and large, the polls famously&#xD;&#xA;predicted the wrong winner.&#xD;&#xA;This leads us to explore the week’s guiding question: How can we best use polls to predict&#xD;&#xA;election outcomes?&#xD;&#xA;To understand the polls’ behavior so far in the 2024 cycle, I visualized the variation over time&#xD;&#xA;and against key events:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Week 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although last week’s debate drew many viewers and much online discussion, some wondered&#xD;&#xA;how much effect it would really have on the outcome of the 2024 election. After all, some&#xD;&#xA;longstanding theories suggest that a candidate’s campaign strategy, debate performance, and&#xD;&#xA;other actions all fall short to economic variables in the task of prediction. After all, if a voter isn’t&#xD;&#xA;doing well economically, wouldn’t that motivate them to seek out a change? And if they are&#xD;&#xA;doing well, shouldn’t they vote for the incumbent in their own self-interest?&#xD;&#xA;The theory of “pocketbook voting” suggests exactly this: that people vote based on their direct&#xD;&#xA;economic situations. In this theory, the economy is the principal variable in an election, and&#xD;&#xA;should therefore be able to predict the results.&#xD;&#xA;This week, we set out to answer the question: Can we predict election outcomes using only the&#xD;&#xA;state of the economy? If so, how well?&#xD;&#xA;Specifically, I looked at GDP and RDI (real disposable income), the former of which is a&#xD;&#xA;measure of nationwide economic productivity and the latter of which represents how much&#xD;&#xA;direct spending power people have.&#xD;&#xA;Following the idea of pocketbook voting most closely, the variable most tightly correlated with&#xD;&#xA;incumbent votes should be RDI. However, GDP is also often used as a predictive measure&#xD;&#xA;because it indicates the overall state of the economy. I compared both measures in a series of&#xD;&#xA;model fits and visualizations that focused on mapping previous presidential elections to&#xD;&#xA;economic conditions and incumbent vote shares.&#xD;&#xA;I also sometimes omitted the case of 2020: as shown in the below two graphs, the change to&#xD;&#xA;the economy caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was unprecedented and made it a significant&#xD;&#xA;outlier.&#xD;&#xA;The following scatter plots graph these two economic measures against the incumbent party’s&#xD;&#xA;popular vote share.&#xD;&#xA;Including 2020:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;imgs/B2I1.png&#34; alt=&#34;GDP&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guiding Questions&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This week, we set out to answer two key questions about presidential elections in the United States.&#xD;&#xA;1) How competitive are presidential elections in the United States?&#xD;&#xA;2) Which states vote blue/red and how consistently?&#xD;&#xA;There are many ways to approach these questions, especially with predictive ends in mind. Is it possible to gather enough data points about a state to accurately understand the likelihood of its individual outcome in the upcoming election?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
