      <description>&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve been looking at predictions using data about previous elections, relative to basic&#xD;&#xA;factors (incumbency, party) as well as to measures of economic well-being. However, we have a&#xD;&#xA;much more recent dataset into which we have not yet tapped: the thousands of public opinion&#xD;&#xA;polls that are conducted each year. Through the principles of sampling, polls appear to be&#xD;&#xA;relatively good estimates; a random subset of the population will behave, on average, similarly&#xD;&#xA;to the whole population. But this doesn’t mean polls have always gotten it right in practice; one&#xD;&#xA;of the most significant examples of this was 2016, where by and large, the polls famously&#xD;&#xA;predicted the wrong winner.&#xD;&#xA;This leads us to explore the week’s guiding question: How can we best use polls to predict&#xD;&#xA;election outcomes?&#xD;&#xA;To understand the polls’ behavior so far in the 2024 cycle, I visualized the variation over time&#xD;&#xA;and against key events:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
