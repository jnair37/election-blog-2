      <description>&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve been looking at predictions using data about previous elections, relative to basic&#xA;factors (incumbency, party) as well as to measures of economic well-being. However, we have a&#xA;much more recent dataset into which we have not yet tapped: the thousands of public opinion&#xA;polls that are conducted each year. Through the principles of sampling, polls appear to be&#xA;relatively good estimates; a random subset of the population will behave, on average, similarly&#xA;to the whole population. But this doesn’t mean polls have always gotten it right in practice; one&#xA;of the most significant examples of this was 2016, where by and large, the polls famously&#xA;predicted the wrong winner.&#xA;This leads us to explore the week’s guiding question: How can we best use polls to predict&#xA;election outcomes?&#xA;To understand the polls’ behavior so far in the 2024 cycle, I visualized the variation over time&#xA;and against key events:&#xA;First, I added key events in 2024 to help understand the poll variation we’ve seen so far this&#xA;year. In context of the timings, the major jump in Democratic approval in this graph is explained&#xA;by Biden’s exit from the race on July 21st and subsequent handoff to Vice President Harris.&#xA;Both parties’ approval rates have most recently been increasing, which could potentially be&#xA;related to the recent dropout of independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the influx of&#xA;third-party voters resigning themselves to approving of one of the two major parties.&#xA;Next, I used some of the machine learning methods we went over in lab to create predictions&#xA;based on the polls. We had learned how to create predictions based on the national polls, using&#xA;the regularized elasticnet regression method, which resulted in a prediction of 51.79268% for&#xA;Harris and 50.65879% for Trump.&#xA;To build on this initial foundation, I tried looking at state polls. For the state I had chosen to&#xA;analyze, Pennsylvania, I found that the state poll data only had one or two polls for each&#xA;election year. This was not enough data to constitute a good training set, so I considered my&#xA;other options. One would be using all the state data in aggregate and indiscriminately, but I&#xA;didn’t think that would produce a very meaningful estimate, as which state a poll came from&#xA;would have no effect on how it was weighted. Another option would be to collect more data on&#xA;state-specific polls, which could be a good approach in the future.&#xA;I then shifted my focus to creating a model based on the assessments of poll quality and their&#xA;resulting performance in 2020, so that I could assign a predicted error to each poll based on&#xA;correlations with its FiveThirtyEight graded score and potentially other poll quality factors. I&#xA;created an ordinary least squares model to achieve this for 2020. I converted the letter grades&#xA;to a numeric scale, so that I could perform a linear regression on the poll grades. This found a&#xA;correlation between poll grades and error, as visualized below (1 = best; 10 = worst), but FTE&#xA;has since changed its grading system from a letter grade to a different numeric scale; therefore,&#xA;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t reapply this model to 2024 data accurately.&#xA;If I could establish a direct conversion rate between the old and new FTE scales, I would be&#xA;able to use this scale to convert the 2020 correlation data to a 2024 prediction data.&#xA;In the future, I would see if I could find the conversion scale so that I could actually use this to&#xA;create an updated 2024 prediction model!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
