      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although last week’s debate drew many viewers and much online discussion, some wondered&#xD;&#xA;how much effect it would really have on the outcome of the 2024 election. After all, some&#xD;&#xA;longstanding theories suggest that a candidate’s campaign strategy, debate performance, and&#xD;&#xA;other actions all fall short to economic variables in the task of prediction. After all, if a voter isn’t&#xD;&#xA;doing well economically, wouldn’t that motivate them to seek out a change? And if they are&#xD;&#xA;doing well, shouldn’t they vote for the incumbent in their own self-interest?&#xD;&#xA;The theory of “pocketbook voting” suggests exactly this: that people vote based on their direct&#xD;&#xA;economic situations. In this theory, the economy is the principal variable in an election, and&#xD;&#xA;should therefore be able to predict the results.&#xD;&#xA;This week, we set out to answer the question: Can we predict election outcomes using only the&#xD;&#xA;state of the economy? If so, how well?&#xD;&#xA;Specifically, I looked at GDP and RDI (real disposable income), the former of which is a&#xD;&#xA;measure of nationwide economic productivity and the latter of which represents how much&#xD;&#xA;direct spending power people have.&#xD;&#xA;Following the idea of pocketbook voting most closely, the variable most tightly correlated with&#xD;&#xA;incumbent votes should be RDI. However, GDP is also often used as a predictive measure&#xD;&#xA;because it indicates the overall state of the economy. I compared both measures in a series of&#xD;&#xA;model fits and visualizations that focused on mapping previous presidential elections to&#xD;&#xA;economic conditions and incumbent vote shares.&#xD;&#xA;I also sometimes omitted the case of 2020: as shown in the below two graphs, the change to&#xD;&#xA;the economy caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was unprecedented and made it a significant&#xD;&#xA;outlier.&#xD;&#xA;The following scatter plots graph these two economic measures against the incumbent party’s&#xD;&#xA;popular vote share.&#xD;&#xA;Including 2020:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;imgs/B2I1.png&#34; alt=&#34;GDP&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
