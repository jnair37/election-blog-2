      <description>&lt;p&gt;Week 5: Demographics and Comprehensive Modeling&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This week, we examined the effects of demographic values on voter turnout and vote choice, based on a paper by Kim and Zilinsky (2023).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The demographics we looked at are age, gender, race, income, and education. Although there are certainly some correlations between demographics and those who vote (active voters are more often older, white, &amp;amp; educated), the study concludes that demographics alone do not tell us that much about partisanship and vote choice. Specifically, a model trained on demographics alone has about a 60% accuracy rate, which holds during our replication of the analysis. This does not significantly improve on a coin flip between the two parties, suggesting that demographics are not a very strong predictor. It was also found that the amount of overall turnout does not push elections in one particular direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
